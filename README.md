**Introduction**

Real-time fraud detection in e-commerce using machine learning helps identify and prevent fraudulent transactions instantly as they occur.
By analyzing user behavior, transaction patterns, device details, and geolocation, ML models can detect anomalies that deviate from normal activity. 
Supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression are trained on historical data to classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent.
Real-time prediction systems are integrated with e-commerce platforms to flag or block suspicious transactions immediately, minimizing financial loss and enhancing security. 
This proactive approach builds trust among users while improving operational efficiency.
